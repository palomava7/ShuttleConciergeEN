		<h3>Xel-Há</h3>
		<p>The world’s largest natural aquarium known as Xel-Ha, it’s an ecological park located in the Solidaridad municipality in the state of Quintana Roo. Its main feature is a beautiful cove where the river connects with the Caribbean Sea which makes the perfect coexistence between more than 70 marine and freshwater species.
		<br><br> Also known as a natural wonder of Mexico, Xel-Ha is located right in the heart of the Mayan Riviera. 102 kilometers from the city of Cancun, 48 kilometers from Playa del Carmen and 13 kilometers from Tulum. In the cove, there is a variety of water sports that can be practiced; such as snorkel and scuba diving. There is also a special area used for activities such as interacting with the dolphins and manatees, zip lines and the Sea Trek which consists on an underwater walk.
<br><br>Around the cove you will find an endless variety of beautiful formations, like a cavern with walls covered in extinct mollusk fossils among other prehistoric specimens. Close to the Cenotes  “Paraiso” and “Aventura”, you will also find a numerous amount of living species of fish and birds in danger of extinction. 
<br><br>In Xel-Ha, besides enjoying endless activities, you can also enjoy an all-inclusive deal of meals and beverages which is included in the cost of the admission ticket for the park.
